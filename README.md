# offline
A simple offline-capable progressive web application todo list.

Created using React, Redux, Webpack, Styled-Components, and 2 awesome libraries: Webpack [Offline Plugin](https://github.com/NekR/offline-plugin) by NekR and [Redux-Offline](https://github.com/jevakallio/redux-offline) by Jevakallio (Also worth nothing that Redux-Offlane uses [Redux Persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist) for offline redux state management).

Made to simulate a true offline-ready progressive web application experience utilizing ServiceWorker for caching assets and application, and LocalForage for offline application data storage.
